Excellent! Your HRM model is now training successfully on CPU! 🎉
Looking at the training output, I can see several positive indicators:
## ✅ Training Success Indicators:

Model loads correctly: All components initialized properly
No tensor errors: The reshape fixes resolved the stride compatibility issues
Loss is decreasing: From 5.26 → 3.40 over 10 epochs, showing the model is learning
Forward pass working: Predictions are being generated (though currently predicting mostly 4s)
Gradient flow: Loss reduction indicates backpropagation is working

## 📊 Training Progress Analysis:

Initial Loss: 5.26 (epoch 1)
Final Loss: 3.40 (epoch 10)
Improvement: ~35% reduction in loss
Pattern: Generally decreasing trend with some fluctuation (normal for small datasets)

## 🔍 Current Model Behavior:
The model is currently predicting mostly 4 tokens, while the ground truth shows diverse values like [7, 10, 4, 9, 5, 1, ...]. This is typical early training behavior - the model starts by predicting the most common token and gradually learns to diversify.
📈 Visualizations Generated:
Your training script created helpful visualizations showing:

Prediction vs Ground Truth: Shows model output compared to expected values
Training Loss: Demonstrates learning progress over epochs

## 🚀 Next Steps to Improve Performance:

Increase Training Time: Run for more epochs (50-100) to see better convergence
Tune Hyperparameters:

Try different learning rates (1e-4, 5e-4)
Adjust model size (more layers/hidden dimensions)


Dataset Expansion: Create more diverse puzzle patterns
Monitor Metrics: Track accuracy alongside loss

## 💾 Model Successfully Saved:
Your trained model is saved as hrm_cpu_model.pth and ready for evaluation or further training.
Would you like me to help you:

Extend the training for more epochs?
Add evaluation metrics (accuracy, exact match)?
Create more diverse training patterns?
Set up model evaluation on the test set?

The foundation is solid - your HRM model is learning! 🎯
